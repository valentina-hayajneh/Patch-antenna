# Inset-Fed Microstrip Patch Antenna @ 2.4 GHz

## Overview
An inset-fed microstrip patch antenna is a popular antenna type used in wireless communication due to its compact size, low profile, and ease of fabrication. The inset-feed technique involves cutting a notch into the patch and feeding the signal at an optimized position within this notch. This method improves the impedance matching between the patch and the feed line compared to simple edge-feeding techniques.
This project involves the design and simulation of an inset-fed microstrip patch antenna operating at 2.4 GHz Using ANSYS  HFSS 
The design is inspired by and benchmarked against the research paper(Design of 2.4 GHz Single Band Inset-Fed Rectangular Microstrip Patch Antenna)([URL](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379504173_Design_Of_24_GHZ_Single_Band_Inset-Fed_Rectangular_Microstrip_Patch_Antenna))

## The Antenna Used for Benchmarking

The figure below shows the reference antenna layout and its physical dimensions used for benchmarking. The design includes the **substrate**, **ground plane**, **rectangular patch**, and **inset feed**.
