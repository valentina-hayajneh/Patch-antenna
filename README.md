# Inset-Fed Microstrip Patch Antenna @ 2.4 GHz

## Overview
An inset-fed microstrip patch antenna is a type of antenna commonly used in wireless communication, particularly for its compact size and ease of fabrication. It involves cutting a portion of the patch and feeding the signal at that point, which helps achieve a better impedance match with the feed line compared to simple edge feeding  .This report aims to design an inset-fed microstrip patch antenna based on specific requirements, and to benchmark the design against the paper titled (Design of 2.4 GHz Single Band Inset-Fed Rectangular Microstrip Patch Antenna).[URL](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/379504173_Design_Of_24_GHZ_Single_Band_Inset-Fed_Rectangular_Microstrip_Patch_Antenna)
