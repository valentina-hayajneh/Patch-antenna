# Inset-Fed Microstrip Patch Antenna @ 2.4 GHz

## Introduction

An **Inset-fed Microstrip Patch Antenna** is a commonly used design in wireless communication, prized for its compact profile and straightforward fabrication. In this approach, a notch is cut into the patch and the feed line is connected at that location, resulting in better impedance matching than simple edge-fed designs.

This project involves designing an **Inset-fed Microstrip Patch Antenna** operating at **2.4 GHz**, and benchmarking its performance against a published reference.
